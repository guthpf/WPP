COMPILING WEBCAMPAPERPEN:

To compile in Windows, you will need:
- Qt5 and QtCreator (http://qt-project.org/)
- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
--- note: Eigen is a template library, only header files are needed.
--- note: you will need to change the include path in WPP.pro appropriately.
- ESCAPI (http://sol.gfxile.net/escapi/)
--- note: only the .dll for ESCAPI is actually required

To compile in Linux, you will need 
- Qt4 and QtCreator (apt-get install libqt4-dev qtcreator)
- Eigen (apt-get install libeigen3-dev)
- OpenCV (apt-get install libopencv-dev)
